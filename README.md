# Grasshopper

```
I tailored the age to fit me.
We walked to the south, raising dust above the steppe;
The tall weeds fumed; the grasshopper danced,
Touching its antenna to the horse-shoes - and it prophesied,
Threatening me with destruction, like a monk.
I strapped my fate to the saddle;
And even now, in these coming times,
I stand up in the stirrups like a child.
```

A CTF container that only requires any modern version of Bash and (almost)
any modern version of Docker.

If everything works as expected, you should be able to just run `./grasshopper` to get started.

If you have to build the image, this will take about 10-20 minutes even with a good internet connection.

## Quick Start

```
./grasshopper
```

## Usage

```
Usage: grasshopper [OPTIONS]

OPTIONS:
  -k    Kill any containers that exist before running
  -b    Re-build the container before running (don't do this)
```
